# riscvboy

riscvboy is a personal RISC-V CPU project implementing a 5-stage pipeline processor based on RV32I instruction set. It is designed for educational and experimental purposes, with a focus on simplicity, modularity and clarity.

ðŸš€ Features
Fully supports the RV32I base instruction set
Classic 5-stage pipeline: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB
Implements basic forwarding and hazard detection
Includes a simple testbench with simulation support

ðŸ§  Goals
Understand RISC-V architecture and pipeline behavior
Explore classic CPU design principles
Serve as a foundation for future SoC integration or extensions
